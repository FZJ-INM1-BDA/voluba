# System requirements

We recommend to use VoluBA with a recent version of the [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) web browsers on a PC (Windows/Linux/MacOS). 
A dedicated graphics card will significantly improve the performance, but is not required to run VoluBA. 

Other browsers may work as well, but not that VoluBA relies on the [WebGL2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) technology, which is not supported by all vendors. 
In particular, the Apple browsers (Safari on MacOS and the [default browsers on iOS devices](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements)) do not support the WebGL2.0 standard.

!!! info
    To check if your device and browser support webgl 2.0, visit <https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/>.

VoluBA will also work on Android mobile devices with the Chrome or Firefox browsers, but it is not recommended to use it on phone or tablet since the user interface has been designed for keyboard and mouse control.
