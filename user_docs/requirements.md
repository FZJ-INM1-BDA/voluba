# System requirements


- recent version of a web browser (e.g. [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/en/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://google.com/intl/en/chrome/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/de/safari/))
- [WebGL2](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)

!!! tip
    To check if your device and browser support WebGL2, visit <https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/>.

**Technical details**

We recommend to use VoluBA with a recent version of Firefox or Chrome on a PC (Windows/Linux/MacOS). 
Other browsers may work as well, but the WebGL2 standard is not supported by all vendors. For example, Apple browsers only support WebGL2 from Version 15.5 onwards.

VoluBA will also work on mobile devices, but it is not recommended to use it on phone or tablet since it has been designed for keyboard and mouse control.

!!! note
    Use a dedicated graphics card to improve the performance of VoluBA.
