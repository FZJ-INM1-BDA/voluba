# Frontend

## Quick start

Fire up the development server:

    cd frontend/app
    npm install
    npm run dev  # (or 'yarn start')
    
Navigate to:
http://localhost:8080


## Building the frontend

To create a bundle use the following command:

    npm run build

It will create a /dist folder on the same level as /app.
